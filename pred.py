"""
This Python file is example of how your `pred.py` script should
look. Your file should contain a function `predict_all` that takes
in the name of a CSV file, and returns a list of predictions.

Your `pred.py` script can use different methods to process the input
data, but the format of the input it takes and the output your script produces should be the same.

Here's an example of how your script may be used in our test file:

    from example_pred import predict_all
    predict_all("example_test_set.csv")


## Data description: 
Q1: From a scale 1 to 5, how complex is it to make this food? (Where 1 is the most simple, and 5 is the most complex)

Q2: How many ingredients would you expect this food item to contain?

Q3: In what setting would you expect this food to be served? Please check all that apply

Q4: How much would you expect to pay for one serving of this food item?

Q5: What movie do you think of when thinking of this food item?

Q6: What drink would you pair with this food item?

Q7: When you think about this food item, who does it remind you of?

Q8: How much hot sauce would you add to this food item?
