Assuming that a quarter of this item is one serving, then with a full item being about $15, I would say that I would expect to pay $3.75 for one serving.  I usually associate this item with the winter because school parties would frequently order this food item. Hence, I would say The Polar Express, Elf, and Home Alone.

"3 Typically, the simplest pizza would contain dough, water, yeast, salt, sugar, tomato sauce, and then cheese - around 7 ingredients.

But for full pizzas, the cost could range anywhere from $12 for a small to $20 for a large.

Similarly, a typical Chinese stir-fry often involves a variety of components, including a primary ingredient (like chicken or tofu), supporting vegetables (such as bell peppers or onions), seasonings (like soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and salt), and additional aromatics (such as garlic, ginger, or scallions). Whether it's Western or Asian cuisine, the number of ingredients often depends on the complexity of the dish and the layering of flavors.
