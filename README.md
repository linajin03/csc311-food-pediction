# CSC311 Winter 2025 Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview
You will receive a CSV file containing student responses about several popular food items. Your
task is to build a classifier that predicts which food item a student is referring to in their response.
We will share the final details of the task after the course staff explores the data.
## Objective
Your goal is to create a classifier that performs well on an unseen test set. This test set, compiled
from responses by TAs and instructors, will not be shared with you. Your model should generalize
well to this unseen data.
## Guidelines
Feel free to use any materials from this course, such as any model or an ensemble of models.
Make sure that your model file submission does not exceed 10MB. We recommend that you pay
careful attention to ensure that your
